        <p>What's not to love about coffee? It's been consumed across the world for over 500 years, starting off in the Arabian peninsula where it was roasted as a tool to help the drinkers stay awake for religious rituals. Now, in the year 2022, myself and many others sip on coffee to start our mornings. Speaking of which, it's time for a refill!</p>
